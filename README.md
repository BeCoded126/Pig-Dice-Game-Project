                                                **The Pig Dice Game**

Starting learning Javascript prior to the full-stack bootcamp and was able to create something called the "Pig Dice Game".

It's a 2 player game with the objective of adding points with a randomized number generator. 

Each player can go as many times as they want but if they hit "0" then their active score will reset without being able to add it to their total.

The player who reaches "100" first, wins.
